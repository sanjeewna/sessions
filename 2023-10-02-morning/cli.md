# CLI

Creating folders (directories) in the command line is a common task when working with a terminal or shell. Here are some best practices for creating folders in the command line:

1. **Use Lowercase Letters**: It's generally a good practice to use lowercase letters for folder names. This helps with consistency and ensures compatibility with different operating systems (as some are case-sensitive).

2. **Avoid Spaces**: Don't use spaces in folder names. Instead, use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) to separate words if needed. Spaces can sometimes cause issues in command-line operations.

3. **Navigate Before Creating**: Ensure you are in the correct directory (folder) before creating a new folder. You can use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the desired location.

4. **Use mkdir Command**: In most command-line environments, you can use the `mkdir` (make directory) command to create a new folder. For example:
```sh
mkdir folder_name
```

5. **Check for Existing Folders**: Before creating a new folder, check if a folder with the same name already exists in the current directory. You can use the `ls` or `dir` command to list the contents of the directory.
