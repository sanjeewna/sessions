## Part 2: What

###  What is Full-Stack Development?

- [Roadmap FS].
- Mastering both the frontend and backend 
- DevOps

### What is MERN 

- MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- Role of each technology:
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.
  - Express.js: A backend framework for building robust APIs.
  - React: A library for building interactive user interfaces.
  - Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.

### Another Perspective:

- **Backend:** [Roadmap BE]
- **Frontend:** [Roadmap FE]
- **API (REST) + Documentation:**
- **DevOps:**
- **Testing:**
- **Security:**


### Hands on Project:
- Prototyping (low vs high fidelity)
- Scrum, Sprints

------
## Part 3: HOW

### Industry vs Academia

- We'll adopt a balanced approach:
- **One foot in industry:** Real-world applications and practical skills: [Scrimba], [Freecodecamp], [Traversy Media]
- **One foot academia:** A solid foundation in theories and concepts: [Full Stack open]

###  Teaching Method:

- Straightforward assignments to illustrate single concepts.
- Mini projects 
- Independent study to explore additional topics like Flexbox and Figma.
- Optional Independent study for advanced concepts like Material UI.


### Interactive Learning:

- Group work 
- Pair programming
- Team based learning
- Flipped classroom
- Mini lectures

### [AI](./AI.md)

- You can use ChatGPT during class for assistance    
  - not during the exam
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

### Deliverables:

- Reflection journal to track your progress and insights.
- In-class activities to reinforce learning.
- Four sprints for the project, each lasting two weeks.

###  Online and In-Person Logistics:

- Our sessions will take place online through Zoom.
